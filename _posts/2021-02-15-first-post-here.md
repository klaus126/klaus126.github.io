### Even a 30-minute run can lift symptoms of depression and improve mood.

Spending 30 minutes on a treadmill is enough to lift the mood of someone suffering from major depressive disorder, according to a [study published in the journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331126) of the American College of Sports Medicine. Even participants who moved at a walking pace to received the same mood-lifting benefit.

This shows that no matter what pace you're going, moving has positive effects and adds to the already significant body of research showing that running and other forms of exercise [can improve mood](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise.aspx) and help fight depression.





### Contrary to what many people think, running actually seems to improve knee health.

Knee pain can quickly sideline a runner. It's often a sign of overtraining or a need to improve one's form or flexibility. But running probably isn't the cause of knee osteoarthritis.

In [one eight-year study of 2,637 participants](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acr.22939), researchers found that the more people ran, the less likely they were to suffer from knee pain or osteoarthritis. While it's hard to say that running directly caused people to experience less knee pain, researchers think that could be the case since running helps people keep their BMI in check and their leg muscles strong. Running also [strengthens bones](https://www.bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/bone-health/exercise/exercise-your-bone-health).
